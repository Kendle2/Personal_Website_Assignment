        <strong><em>This</em> is body paragraph one.</strong> In this paraghraph I am using the A tag. The A tag makes the font green. You may notice that the font is green. This is becasuse I used the A Tag.

        <br><strong> Woah</strong> now this paragrahp is in black. That is so crazy. <em> And now this is slanted. Its almost like I am required to do this to get my points!</em> I have not a clue what I a supposed to talk about for 4  paragraphs but here you go. How was your day. I hope grading is treating you well.<br>
   

    
        <br><strong> Now we have entered a new paraghraph</strong> <em>Now this is slanted again. </em> Now its not anymore. Please be kind when grading this. I forgot this was a thing and now this is due and like an hour and I might be cooked. I hope I am making this entertaing for you. Ignore the mispellings I am not good at spelling things. Do you like among us?? This may be some subtle forshadowing.....
     <br> <strong>We made it!</strong> This is the last paragraph. Harrah. Are you entertaned? I am almost done now. I hope your almost done grading too. <em> Goodbye for now I guess.</em>
